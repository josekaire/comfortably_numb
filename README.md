This repository has all the necessary files to replicate the analyses in Comfortably Numb. 

There are three scripts, one for each type of analysis in the article: the analysis of the self-report data, the analysis of the biometric data using a hierchcial linear model, and the DCC analysis. 

You should be able to download each script and run the relevant analysis wihtout downloading the data, but just in case we also include the data for download.
